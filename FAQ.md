<h4 align="center">Frequently Asked Question</h4>

* **Question** : What is Open Source Society, and what does it mean to have self-taught education in Computer Science !?

* **Answer** : Right now, OSSU provide a Computer Science curriculum. This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science course on your own time, for free, with open courses from the best universities in the World. In the future we will provide other curriculums (We have talk about Electrical Engineering) and tools which facilitate self-learners to share and learn among a community. To know more about the mission of OSSU, see [the mission statement](MISSION.md).


* **Q** : Woa, I need so many years to complete the curriculum, am I supposed to do everything?

* **A** : Yes and no. Yes if you want to get the complete skills than provide this curriculum you have to follow the full curriculum. No because you are free to build your own curriculum from the core we provide and make it your own, adapt it to your own personnal needs. By example you could focus on math and algorithms as it would help you for your programming and dev skills.


* **Q** : The material content from the course appear to be closed, there seem to have no mean to access it !

* **A** : Though we encourage Self-paced learning, some courses are closed by the MOOC plateform and are open only at certain intervalle of time. As an advice, you should check them right now and register to it even if you won't do it now, because, when it will close you will still keep the access to the materials. If you see one of this course opening, don't hesitate to tell the community about it. (by ex: the automata course on coursera is open until 6 november 2015) You should consider to enroll to all the course you plan to do in the futures, as the course could be closed later.


* **Q** : I have seen a repo called ossu-api or ossu-ui ? What is it actually ?

* **A** : We're currently working on a website that handles user profiles, including tracking curriculum, progress, and possibly more in the future. Ossu-api is the back-end dev repository and ossu-ui is the front-end. Both teams are working together to ensure a speedy launch of the site. Anyone can participate to the development and join the dev team. [Here more details](https://github.com/open-source-society/ossu-ui/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).


* **Q** : I have a problem to solve and I spent hours on it, what can I do ? 
* **A** : The first thing you can do, is to not pass hours on the same problem, sometimes it make it worse, just taking some distance by allowing yourself to stop to focus and to relax can bring you a different perspective and at some point later have the inspiration that could help you to solve the problem. If you are really stuck, search your answer on google, reddit, stackoverflow. If you still don't find your answer then, come and ask to the community, explain the course/problem you are at, explain your problem and someone coming around could help you. And remember, [don't ask if you can ask something](http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html) just ask. :)

Also, we recommend to the students who feel a bit lost with their learning process and often stuck (or have trouble with procrastination and give up their project) to take the great introduction [learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) which can give you insight about the way you learn and help you to keep motivation, fun and methods to learn efficiently.

* **Q** : If I complete this program and gain knowledge which is equivalent to what I would get with a traditional university program, would I face difficulties landing a software development job without an official BS degree in computer science?

* **A** : Yes and No, if you really acquire the skills, do the projects and have a great porfolio, you will have the experience as a proof than you can take the job. If you just have the knowledge but don't have the personal project porfolio, the fact you don't have a certified degree will be difficult to compete with the one who have the certification. As a self learner, what is really important here is the porfolio to get a lot of practice and experience, that fact can change everything. You can build your porfolio by following personals projects on the side of the learning, and also participating to open source projects on github.
Little by little if you believe in yourself, put the time and the practice, everything is possible. 


* **Q** : I think what course propose are not enough to get practice, need more exercices and projects where I can learn by doing, and reinforce my new learned skills.

* **A** : We really focus on community sharing and we will create tools to encourage that to a high level, in short term we will have a curated file by community that collect all the ideas for projects related to every courses from the curriculum and than you can use as challenge to practice and build your own project porfolio than you need.
