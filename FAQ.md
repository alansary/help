<h4 align="center">Frequently Asked Question</h4>

### What is Open Source Society, and what does it mean to have self-taught education in Computer Science !?

Right now, OSSU provide a Computer Science curriculum. This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science course on your own time, for free, with open courses from the best universities in the World. In the future we will provide other curriculums (We have talk about Electrical Engineering) and tools which facilitate self-learners to share and learn among a community. To know more about the mission of OSSU, see [the mission statement](MISSION.md).


### Woah, it will take a couple years to complete the curriculum. Am I really supposed to do everything?

Yes and no. Yes, if you want to learn the complete set of skills that this curriculum provides you have to follow the full curriculum. No because you are free to build your own curriculum from the core we provide and make it your own by adapting it to your own personal needs. For example, you could focus on math and algorithms to supplement your programming and dev skills, or if you're already familiar with the basics of computer science you can learn about big data or machine learning.


### Some of the courses appear to be closed and there doesnt seem to be a way to access their content! What should I do?

Though we encourage Self-paced learning, some courses are closed by the MOOC plateform and are only open at certain time intervals. We suggest you check them right now and register for the courses even if you won't complete them now. Once you've registered you should have access to most of the material even after the course officially ends. If you see that one of the courses is starting soon, don't hesitate to tell the community about it. (For example: the automata course on coursera is open until 6 november 2015) Again, you should consider enrolling now for all of the open courses you plan to do in the future as the course could be closed later.


### I have a problem to solve and I've already spent hours on it, what can I do ? 

The first thing you can do is to not spend too much time on the same problem, as sometimes that makes finding a solution even harder. Get some distance from the problem by allowing yourself to relax and stop focusing on it. This can bring you a different perspective and at some point later you might have the inspiration you need to solve the problem. If you are really stuck, search for an answer on google, reddit, or stackoverflow. If you still can't find your answer, come and ask to the community. Explain what your problem is: what course is it for and which assignment, question, or concept you're struggling with. Someone will be around to help you. And remember, [don't ask if you can ask something](http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html) just ask. :)

Also, we recommend to students who feel a bit lost with their learning process and often stuck (or have trouble with procrastination and give up on their projects) to take the great introduction [learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/). It can give you insight into the way you learn and help you to stay motivated and have fun with methods to learn efficiently.


### If I complete this program and gain knowledge which is equivalent to what I would get with a traditional university program, would I face difficulties landing a software development job without an official BS degree in computer science?

Yes and No. If you really acquire the skills, do the projects and have a great porfolio, you will have the experience as a proof than you can do the job. If you just have the knowledge but don't have the personal project porfolio, the fact you don't have a certified degree will make it difficult to compete with someone who does have a degree. As a self learner, what is really important here is building a porfolio to get a lot of practice and experience. That fact can change everything. You can build your porfolio by following personals projects on the side of the learning, and also participating in open source projects on github.
Little by little if you believe in yourself and put in the time and the practice, everything is possible. 


### I think the proposed courses are not enough. To get the necessary practice and experience I need more exercices and projects where I can learn by doing, and reinforce my newly learned skills.

We really focus on community sharing and we will create tools to encourage that to a high level. In the short term we have a [list of projects](PROJECTS.md) curated by the community related to each course in the curriculum. You can use these challenges to practice and build your own project porfolio.
