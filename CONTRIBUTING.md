## Being a member of the OSSU Community

At OSSU, we consider students and teachers to be the core members of the community, and you don’t need to ask for any particular status in the team to be a part of it. To become a contributor, simply participate using the differents tools and channels that we have established. You can apply for the curriculum following the instructions here.

## Being a member of the Community Management Team

That being said if you want to join as a member of the OSSU organization and in particular to the community management team you should know that the purpose of this membership is to support and be in service of the core community by offering the structural organization and by helping others to focus first on their learning and sharing process instead of letting them struggle alone with “How things work”. The primary aim is to facilitate the spirit of the community to be ... a community, and to try to solve all the problems that could hinder it.

## Here are the steps you need to take:

1. Fill out [this form](#) (Not yet open, you can open an issue in the help repo and tell us about you)
2. Within 48 hours we will send you a Slack invite so you can introduce yourself and come chat with us. You will learn more about us this way. Don’t hesitate to introduce yourself, we are really friendly. :smile:
3. If all goes well, we will send you invites to the OSS organization on GitHub as well as our task tracker

## Examples of needs and ways to contribute to the OSSU community:

* Community managers (if you feel you have a lot of time to do a bit of everything)
* Github maintainers (help and computer-science repositories)
* Moderators (Participate in assuring a great ambience among the different channels of the community: reddit, gitter, blog discussions, mailing lists, etc..)
* Technical Writers (Write documentations and tutorials and share useful links which could help the community of students and teachers on their paths to a free and open source education)
* Proof/Grammar readers (help non english speakers to share their ideas, and to clean the texts of OSSU.)
* Content Writers (sharing experiences and advice on OSSU blog/medium/newsletter. The life of the community)
* Video editors (making videos for the university)
* Audio editors (making podcasts for the university)
* Graphics Artists (for many opportunities to bring a living style to the university)
* Voice actors (for podcasts and videos)
* And to finish, like one of the pillars of wikipedia says : [Be Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold), Don’t be afraid to show us your initiatives and ideas, don’t think there is nothing you can do to participate (as a society) in a free and open source university. It is all about creativity, and we all are creative in some way or another.

Once again, it’s not necessity to be part of the community management team to take on responsibility for any or all of the above. For example, we could call for a community logo and you could propose your art without needing to be part of the community management team. In the future, many tools will be given to the core community which will allow sharing of creative contents directly in a peer to peer, fluid process. (youtubes videos, podcasts, news, articles)

Feel free to choose what is the best for you based on your own needs and preferences.
